# Typing Speed Calculator

This is a simple Typing Speed Calculator application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to test their typing speed by typing a randomly selected sentence and calculates their characters per second (CPS), characters per minute (CPM), words per second (WPS), and words per minute (WPM) based on their typing performance.

## Features

- Randomly selects sentences from a text file for typing practice.
- Calculates typing speed in characters per second (CPS), characters per minute (CPM), words per second (WPS), and words per minute (WPM).
- Provides instant feedback on typing accuracy and performance.
- Records and displays the best typing speed achieved during the session.
- Reset option to start a new typing test with a new sentence.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohamedSa3d04/Speed-Typing-Calc.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd typing-speed-calculator
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python Speed-Typing-Calc.py
```

## Usage

1. Type the given sentence in the input box as accurately and quickly as possible.
2. The application will calculate your typing speed in real-time and display CPS, CPM, WPS, and WPM.
3. After completing the test, click the "Reset" button to start a new test with a different sentence.
